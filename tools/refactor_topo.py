desc:
    This python script refactors the very large topology.py module into several
    files based on the topological heirarchical order:
    + shape_core.py - base classes Shape, ShapeList
    + utils.py - utility classes & functions
    + zero_d.py - Vertex
    + one_d.py - Mixin1D, Edge, Wire
    + two_d.py - Mixin2D, Face, Shell
    + three_d.py - Mixin3D, Solid
    + composite.py - Compound
    Each of these modules import lower order modules to avoid import loops. They
    also may contain functions used both by end users and higher order modules.
