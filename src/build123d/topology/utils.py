desc:

This module provides utility functions and helper classes for the build123d CAD library, enabling
advanced geometric operations and facilitating the use of the OpenCascade CAD kernel. It complements
the core library by offering reusable and modular tools for manipulating shapes, performing Boolean
operations, and validating geometry.

Key Features:
- **Geometric Utilities**:
  - `polar`: Converts polar coordinates to Cartesian.
  - `tuplify`: Normalizes inputs into consistent tuples.
  - `find_max_dimension`: Computes the maximum bounding dimension of shapes.

- **Shape Creation**:
  - `_make_loft`: Creates lofted shapes from wires and vertices.
  - `_make_topods_compound_from_shapes`: Constructs compounds from multiple shapes.
  - `_make_topods_face_from_wires`: Generates planar faces with optional holes.

- **Boolean Operations**:
  - `_topods_bool_op`: Generic Boolean operations for TopoDS_Shapes.
  - `new_edges`: Identifies newly created edges from combined shapes.

- **Enhanced Math**:
  - `isclose_b`: Overrides `math.isclose` with a stricter absolute tolerance.

This module is a critical component of build123d, supporting complex CAD workflows and geometric
transformations while maintaining a clean, extensible API.
